      <p>During my time in high school, I have explored careers that interest me through many different interactions with different types of people. Influential speakers that I have been inspired by include Devon Martin, an influential speaker from Chevron, and Shawn Mehaffey, who was also from Chevron. They focused on their backstories and how they got to where they are today, and their careers had inspired me because they had very similar upbringings and similar experiences. Doing research on open positions in the field throughout the years helped me gain an understanding for what employers are looking for. By understanding what is consistently necessary and what can be easily replaced, I could focus on being able to land a stable job in which I could enjoy my job without having to worry about being cut.</p>
    <p>In addition, I was introduced to the workforce during my experience with theCoderSchool San Ramon. I was able to learn how it felt to improve my programming skills in an environment made for programming, while being able to help younger students who were eager to learn. Further, I am currently employed at T4 as I had decided it was important to pick up on customer service skills especially if I were to go into an IT job or any job in the software engineering field as communication is important in those fields. These jobs have greatly improved my decision making and understanding for employers as well as employees.</p>
