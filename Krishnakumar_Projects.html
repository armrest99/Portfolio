        <li>9/3/19-9/11/19</li>
          <p>The Scratch Project was our first project in CSP. We were learning how to do pair programming to make a game in scratch. From scratch. My partner for this project was Surya Kethineni. The game that we made was a story mode game about a robber. We made the game interactive and fun, using cool dialogue lines and characters.</p>

        <li>9/23/19-10/04/19</li>
         <p>This Project was about making an app in MIT app inventor. My partner and I based our game on Mole Mash V2. What we had to do was use an already made base project and give it cool features so that people would enjoy playing the game. We added features, such as, a point system, fire, a timer, and a high score.</p>

         <p>This was our first project after the shelter-in-place was issued. I did this project with Pranav Guda. We decided to make an advertisement for a lemon-scented mask. This project was exciting to work on and being able to manipulate images to add any effect on it was fun to work with and change.</p>

        <h1 class="text">Compound Machine Project (Principles of Engineering)</h1>
         <li>11/10/20-12/04/20</li>
         <p>This was our longest and most taxing project we had in Principles of Engineering. The project required me to not only brainstorm, design, think, and build a compound machine, but also included calculating the IMA of the entire machine as well as communicating our problems and successes with our team. In the small alloted time frame, I was able to complete not only the individual deliverables but also contributed a great amount to the documentation, including the design brief, brainstorming sketches, final designs, and overall layout, all of which can be viewed in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gVbCl-65X9UWz1QafPgAKkyM-bEvZKfipPR_vVJSie4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" text-primary"><strong>documentation.</strong></a></p>
         <p>Challenges during this project not only included a small alloted time frame but also space and material constrictions. I not only had to change my original design, I also had to shorten my lever to stay within the amount of space that I had.</p>

        <h1 class="text">Bridge Project (Principles of Engineering)</h1>
         <li>3/19/21-4/02/21</li>
         <p>This project had us design a bridge in the program, Bridge Designer 2016. It took me alot of time to adjust to the program and actually be able to design a bridge that cost less than 400,000 dollars. I needed to be able to have enough strength to keep the bridge up under the allotted weight, while not being able to use as many materials as I would have liked. As I kept brainstorming and researching how different materials work, as well as different kinds of ways that bridges are designed, I managed to create a bridge that held up the weight with minimum movement. The bridge ended up only costing less than 200k. I then put our research and features on a presentation to sell our idea. My thought process and ideas can be seen in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hyqyXabZS5YtMhTiNewRvISeQvwSqXPUs28DEaqJUiU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" text-primary"><strong>documentation.</strong></a></p>
         <p>Challenges during this project had a lot to do with time constraints and learning the program. Since it was a program that we were unfamiliar with, it took us a while to learn the ins and outs of designing the bridge using different materials.</p>
