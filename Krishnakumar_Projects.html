          <p>The Scratch Project was our first project in CSP. We were learning how to do pair programming to make a game in scratch. From scratch. My partner for this project was Surya Kethineni. The game that we made was a story mode game about a robber. We made the game interactive and fun, using cool dialogue lines and characters.</p>

         <p>This Project was about making an app in MIT app inventor. My partner and I based our game on Mole Mash V2. What we had to do was use an already made base project and give it cool features so that people would enjoy playing the game. We added features, such as, a point system, fire, a timer, and a high score.</p>

         <p>This was our first project after the shelter-in-place was issued. I did this project with Pranav Guda. We decided to make an advertisement for a lemon-scented mask. This project was exciting to work on and being able to manipulate images to add any effect on it was fun to work with and change.</p>

         <p>This project required me to not only brainstorm, design, think, and build a compound machine, but also included calculating the IMA of the entire machine as well as communicating our problems and successes with our team. I was able to complete not only the individual deliverables but also contributed a great amount to the documentation, including the design brief, brainstorming sketches, final designs, and overall layout, all of which can be viewed in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gVbCl-65X9UWz1QafPgAKkyM-bEvZKfipPR_vVJSie4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" text-primary"><strong>documentation.</strong></a></p>

         <li>3/19/21-4/02/21</li>
         <p>This project had us design a bridge in the program, Bridge Designer 2016. It took me alot of time to adjust to the program and actually be able to design a bridge that cost less than 400,000 dollars. I needed to be able to have enough strength to keep the bridge up under the allotted weight, while not being able to use as many materials as I would have liked. As I kept brainstorming and researching how different materials work, as well as different kinds of ways that bridges are designed, I managed to create a bridge that held up the weight with minimum movement. The bridge ended up only costing less than 200k. I then put our research and features on a presentation to sell our idea. My thought process and ideas can be seen in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hyqyXabZS5YtMhTiNewRvISeQvwSqXPUs28DEaqJUiU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" text-primary"><strong>documentation.</strong></a></p>
         <p>Challenges during this project had a lot to do with time constraints and learning the program. Since it was a program that we were unfamiliar with, it took us a while to learn the ins and outs of designing the bridge using different materials.</p>

         <p>This project had us design a way to control the character in the game to escape the room. We were provided with most of the code and were instructed to add unique features to make our game enjoyable. Our estimated time for the project was much higher than we actually took since we were extremely time efficient. We were able to add more features because of this and add extra features that weren't on the list. My thought process and ideas can be seen in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14azfqhrAM5Zy5VTcl_BtKfQj5F0ZnQcm3_Xi-Hx-Qig/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" text-primary"><strong>documentation.</strong></a></p>
         <p>Challenges during this project had a lot to do with time constraints and dealing with errors that would arise from syntax. We also had trouble collaborating as many people had different ideas but we managed to come to a compromise relatively quick.</p>

         <p>This project was one of our largest and most taxing as it took alot of cooperation and time in order to create our project. We decided to create a drone that could replant trees in deforested areas. However, due to a lack of resources and time, we weren't able to complete our first prototype. We hope that we can create a working prototype in the future with all the parts shown in the CAD model.</p>

         <li>11/1/22-11/7/22</li>
         <p>For Project 1.3.1, my partner Ali and I had to find apparent as well as hidden issues that were located in a virtual lab. From this activity, I learned how to problem solve and effectively deal with issues that could occur when protecting a system against cyber attacks. Each issue was documented here under Unit 1.3.1. The first issue we found was that there was a suspicious owner for this file and removed its permissions so that it couldn’t run any suspicious applications. Next we found a suspicious python application running in the background that could be potential malware, so we ended the task. We then detected some suspicious downloaded files in our download folder and removed them. We continued to find some suspicious files on our disk with names and owners that we didn’t recognize and removed them from the folder. Next, I found some files in the recycle bin that were suspicious and needed to be fully deleted. I restored my chrome web browser because that is a trusted file that we need to use before removing the rest of them. Then, I found that my firewall was off! This allows malware and suspicious files to be sent directly to my computer without a way to stop it. I had to turn it back on. I went on to find that my web and email protection was disabled so I re-enabled it using AVG business security so that I could be safe while browsing the web. Next, I deleted the suspicious file foo1.exe because it was an unknown python file that could have been running a malicious program. Next, I removed another suspicious python file called foo2, which could have also been running malware in the background. Lastly, I found a third foo file which was an unknown python file stored in a suspicious folder which I deleted to completely fix my computer protection and make it safe from outside attacks.</p>

         <li>2/26/23-3/5/23</li>
         <p>For Project 3.1.4, I had to identify malicious users and files that were present in the system. I started off by identifying the users, which were the reason that the malicious files were in the system in the first place. Next, I accessed the root in order to kill the command that was slowing down the system. I then found a file that contained random words and was most likely hiding a virus, which I promptly removed. Finally, I repeated the process for the directories owned by the malicious users at the beginning, completely ridding the system of any behavior that could cause it to slow down or leak information.</p>
