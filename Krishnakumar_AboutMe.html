      <p>The things I have achieved so far are very important to me. For example, I won multiple VEX robotics tournaments and I have won multiple chess tournaments. I have also volunteered at events such as Splatter and the Dublin High Carnival. From my experiences I've learned to push myself, work as hard as I can, and I've learned to focus. Overall I feel that I have grown alot in high school and am ready for the future.</p>
      <p>My goal sophomore year in particular was to qualify for worlds with my robotics team. I was very close to achieving this goal until the COVID-19 outbreak caused the rest of the season to be canceled and we unfortunately had to stop there. It was still a fun time and I am excited that I was able to be a part of it. As the shelter in place continued, I was able to use my free time to continue improving on myself and had time to indulge in my hobbies</p>
        <p>As the 2021-2022 school year got closer, I started to think about how I would be able to improve myself in order to get into a strong college. I began by working at The Coder School, as well as continuing with the robotics team. I hope to continue joining more social clubs in order to work with many different perspectives.
      </p>

        Junior year, I tried again to lead my team to the VEX robotics world championship. We came up just short and made our exit in the quarterfinals of the Norcal state championship. Even though we weren't able to go to worlds as a team, I still grew exponentially this year as a coder and as a builder. My communication skills and cooperation skills also grew as I spent countless hours perfecting the robot along with my teammates. My hope is that I can use these skills to achieve my goal of qualifying to the VEX world championship in the 2022-2023 year.
      </p>
      <p>
        My senior year so far has seen a lot of challenges that I have had to overcome. My experience with robotics this year was difficult as I found myself sinking 30+ hours a week into this commitment. However, the results did not come easily as my ambition inhibited me from reaching my goal of winning the World Championship. Nevertheless, I gained many technical skills that will definitely prove useful in the future, especially with my focus on Computer Science and Robotics Engineering.
