      <p>When asked what my career goals are, my mind instantly goes to engineer. Engineering and computers are things that have always fascinated me. I plan to graduate from high school and go to a college where I can major in the field of engineering. It is possible that my plans may change, but right now itâ€™s what my goals are. I chose this career since it is one that I feel I can find the most success in since I have been learning about it for a very long time and engineering and computers are two of the most interesting things to me.</p>
      <p>While working on projects in computer science, working with other people was always beneficial and being cooperative lead me to being able to do more than 2 times the work that I could've done on my own. During extracurricular activities, such as the Dublin High School Robotics Club, it helps to be accurate while working so that your results come out cleanly. Robotics has helped me be accurate while working on a lot of things, even more than just robotics.</p>
      <p>The things I have achieved so far are very important to me. For example, I made it into the robotics club and I have won multiple chess tournaments. I have also volunteered at some things such as Splatter and during the Dublin High Carnival. From my experiences I've learned to push myself, work as hard as I can, and I've learned to focus. Overall I feel that I have grown alot in high school and am ready for the future.</p>
      <p>My goal last year in particular was to qualify for worlds with my robotics team. I was very close to achieving this goal until the COVID-19 outbreak caused the rest of the season to be canceled and we unfortunately had to stop there. It was still a fun time and I am excited that I was able to be a part of it. As the shelter in place continued, I was able to use my free time to continue improving on myself and had time to indulge in my hobbies</p>
      <p>As the 2021-2022 school year got closer, I started to think about how I would be able to improve myself in order to get into a strong college. I began by working at The Coder School, as well as continuing with the robotics team. I hope to continue joining more social clubs and am even thinking about joining a sport later in the year. Thank you for taking the time to read about me, feel free to check out the rest of the page.</p>
